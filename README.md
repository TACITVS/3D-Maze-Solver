# P5.js Maze Agent

A maze-solving visualization project built with P5.js that demonstrates pathfinding algorithms in action.

## Description

This project implements an agent that can navigate through procedurally generated mazes using P5.js. The visualization shows how the agent explores and solves the maze in real-time.

## Features

- Dynamic maze generation
- Interactive visualization
- Pathfinding algorithm implementation
- Real-time maze solving demonstration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Web browser

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Or visit the live demo (if available)

## Usage
